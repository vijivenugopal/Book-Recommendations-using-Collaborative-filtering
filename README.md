# Book-Recommendations-using-Collaborative-filtering

The objective of this project is to give personalized book recommendations using GoodReads. For this, users with similar tastes in books are identified first using their previous reviews. And the personalized recommendations (predictions) are based on what these users have liked. The GoodReads Book data scraped by UCSD Research Engineers available at https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph is used.
